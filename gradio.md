# GRADIO
Gradio is the fastest way to demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it, anywhere!
### Fast, easy setup
  * Gradio can be installed with pip. Creating a Gradio interface only requires adding a couple lines of code to your project.
  * Seamlessly use any python library on your computer. If you can write a python function, gradio can run it.
### Present and share
  * Gradio can be embedded in Python notebooks or presented as a webpage.
  * A Gradio interface can automatically generate a public link you can share with colleagues that lets them interact with the model on your computer remotely from their own devices.
###Permanent hosting
  * Once you've created an interface, you can permanently host it on Hugging Face.
  * Hugging Face Spaces will host the interface on its servers and provide you with a link you can share.
