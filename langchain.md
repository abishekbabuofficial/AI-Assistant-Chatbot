# LANGCHAIN ü¶úÔ∏è
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also:
  1. Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
  2. Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment
